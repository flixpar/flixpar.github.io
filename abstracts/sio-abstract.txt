Inverse Optimization (IO) aims to infer the parameters of an optimization problem from observed outputs of the decision-making process. Many practical applications of IO involve multiple observed decisions which can be sub-optimal or infeasible, yet existing methods for this setting make strong assumptions that often do not hold in practice. In particular, these methods assume that observations are approximately optimal for the true forwards optimization problem, even though the parameters of this optimization problem are unknown. The result is that traditional IO approaches may be overly conservative and biased towards what was done in the past. At the same time, machine learning approaches to IO cannot guarantee optimal or even feasible decisions.

To address these limitations, we propose Supervised Inverse Optimization (SIO), which aims to meld existing approaches for IO with supervised learning by incorporating scores for each observation, and learning the objective function parameters through a model that optimizes IO and regression objectives. The observation scores represent partial information about the objective function, which is often available, and reduces the reliance on assumptions, which improves performance. The model is highly flexible and can model problems with linear or non-linear objectives, objectives with unknown structure, multiple scores per observation, and many other problem settings.

SIO is valuable in real-world applications including diet recommendation, resource allocation, optimizing clinical pathways, finding shortest paths in traffic networks, and improving radiation therapy plans. We demonstrate this with empirical results for the data-driven diet recommendation problem and other challenging IO problems.
