The analysis of physiological signals is crucial for patient monitoring and clinical decision-making, but the complexity and heterogeneity of medical time series data pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning and signal processing techniques. We introduce MedTsLLM, a multi-modal large language model (LLM) framework which effectively integrates both time series data and rich contextual information to analyze physiologic signals, performing three tasks with clinical relevance: semantic segmentation, boundary detection, and anomaly detection. These critical tasks enable deeper analysis of physiologic signals and can provide actionable insights for clinicians. We utilize a reprogramming layer to align embeddings of time series patches with a pretrained LLM's embedding space to make effective use of raw time series in conjunction with textual context. Given the multivariate nature of medical datasets, we also develop covariate handling methods and tailor the text prompt to include patient-specific information. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including deep learning models, other LLMs, and clinical methods across multiple medical domains, specifically electrocardiograms and respiratory waveforms. MedTsLLM presents a promising step towards harnessing the power of LLMs for medical time series analysis that can elevate data-driven tools for clinicians and improve patient outcomes.
